  #Playwright Project
  
  * This is an automation infrastructure that was developed in TypeScript using Playwright test automation framework for UI end to end tests.
  
  * The infra was developed on the DemoBlaze Website in the page object model design pattern 

  * as part of the project I wrote end to end tests, executed all tests, recieved reports, analyzed results
  
  * for reporting I used allure reports to recieve well desgiend and structured reports based on how I tag and orginize each and every test.
